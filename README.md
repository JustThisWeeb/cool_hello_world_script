# cool_hello_world_script
it's just a cool little hello world I wrote a while back because I saw it in an instagram video


I don't really see the point in this readme file considering how the name of the script kinda explains what it is. Just a more interesting version of the famous "hello world" script.

This one does take input though so you can just put in any phrase you want and it will start doing a cmatrix-like action. Using a language other than english is something you can do but it will take longer for the script to actually get to the symbols in the ascii table.
